# AdventOfCode2019
My Take on the Advent of Code Challenges for 2019, done in Kotlin.
Not necessarily solutions to all exercises, but the ones I had the chance to take the time and do.


This repo is not focusing at best practices in code structuring, only at solving the challenges and learning Kotlin.
